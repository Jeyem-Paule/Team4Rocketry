#Team4Rocketry
This repository documents the design, simulation, and fabrication of an L1 high power rocket designed and built by a student led team under UTD AIAA l1 rocketry (Fall 2025). The project focused on structural integrity, mass optimization, and stable flightperformance under an H-class motor.
________________

## Main Overview
- Motor: Aerotech H135W
- Total Length: 32.67in 
- Simulation tool: OpenRocket 
- CAD: Solidworks 

## Project Scope
This repository focuses on engineering design artifacts, including:
- Flight simulations and stability analysis
- Mechanical CAD models and assemblies
- Design iteration history

Detailed fabrication procedures, launch operations, and certification
documentation are not included.

## Design Summary
The rocket configuration was iteratively refined through OpenRocket simulations
to ensure stable flight and acceptable mass margins for an H-class motor.
Structural components were modeled in CAD with emphasis on manufacturability
and robustness. A final configuration was selected based on simulation results
and physical constraints.

## Project Status
✅ Design complete  
✅ Fabricated  
✅ Successfully flown and recovered

Would have gained l1 Certification if built individually and flown through test. Landed 800m from launch site, very very long walk but managed to recover in one piece unscathed. Very successful Technical Team Project, props to members of Team 4
